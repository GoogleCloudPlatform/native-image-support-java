# BigTable Sample Application with Native Image

This application uses the [Google Cloud BigTable Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/libraries) and is compatible with Native Image compilation.

The application runs through some simple BigTable Client Library operations to demonstrate compatibility.

## Setup Instructions

1. Follow the [GCP Project and Native Image Setup Instructions](../../README.md).

2.  BigTable Environment setup -
    The following sections describe how you can run the sample application against the BigTable emulator or a real BigTable instance.
  
    1. *(Using emulator)* If you wish to run the application against the [BigTable emulator](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/emulator), ensure that you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed.

       In a new terminal window, start the emulator via `gcloud`:
    
       ```
       gcloud beta emulators bigtable start --host-port=localhost:9010
       ```
   
       Leave the emulator running in this terminal for now.
       In the next section, we will run the sample application against the BigTable emulator instance.
    
    2. *(Using real BigTable instance)* If instead you wish to run the application against a real BigTable instance, ensure you already have a BigTable instance created.
    
       For example, the following command creates a new BigTable instance named `native-image-test-instance`.

       ```
       gcloud bigtable instances create native-image-test-instance \
           --cluster=native-image-test-cluster \
           --cluster-zone=us-central1-c \
           --cluster-num-nodes=1 \
           --display-name=native-image-test-instance
       ```
       
       You can also manually manage your BigTable resources through the [BigTable Cloud Console view](http://console.cloud.google.com/bigtable).
    
## Run with Native Image Compilation

1. Navigate to this directory and compile the application with the Native Image compiler.

    ```
    mvn package -P native
    ```

2. **(Optional)** If you're using the emulator, export the `BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST` as an environment variable in your terminal.
   
    ```
    export BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
    ``` 
   
    The BigTable Client Libraries will detect this environment variable and automatically connect to the emulator instance if this variable is set.
    
3. Run the application.
   Pass in the BigTable instance you wish to use via the `-Dbigtable.instance` property.
    
    ```
    ./target/com.example.bigtablesampleapplication -Dbigtable.instance={BIGTABLE_INSTANCE_NAME}
    ```

4. The application will run through some basic BigTable operations and log some output statements.

    ```
