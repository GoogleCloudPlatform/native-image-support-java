# Datastore Sample Application with Native Image

This application uses the [Google Cloud Datastore client library](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/reference/libraries) and is compatible with Native Image compilation.

This sample runs through some basic operations of creating/deleting entities, running queries, and running transaction code.

## Setup Instructions

1. Follow the [GCP Project and Native Image Setup Instructions](../../README.md).

2. If you wish to run the application against the [Datastore emulator](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators/datastore), ensure that you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed.

    In a new terminal window, start the emulator via `gcloud`:
    
    ```
    gcloud beta emulators datastore start --host-port=localhost:9010
    ```
   
    Leave the emulator running in this terminal for now.
    In the next section, we will run the sample application against the Datastore emulator instance.
    
## Run with Native Image Compilation

1. Navigate to this directory and compile the application with the Native Image compiler.

    ```
    mvn package -P native
    ```

2. **(Optional)** If you're using the emulator, export the `DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` as an environment variable in your terminal.
   
    ```
    export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
    ``` 
   
    The Datastore Client Libraries will detect this environment variable and automatically connect to the emulator instance if this variable is set.
    
3. Run the application.
    
    ```
    ./target/datastore-sample
    ```

4. The application will run through some basic Datastore operations and log some output statements.

    ```
    Successfully added entity.
